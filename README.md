### Development Notes:

1. The backend is Flask, the front end is react. Flask needs to server all files from assets whenever requested, without authentication. This is because these files are just CSS and formatting Javascript.
2. The React components displying content need to make requests for this content to the backend, which will check authentication.

## Current to do:

1. Remove Vite code and the Javascript backend that is being managed by node.
