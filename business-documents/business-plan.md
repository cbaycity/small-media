## Art-Hound.io

The main idea is to create a way for artists to host their content but easily control who can access it. This is done by allowing artists to create profiles and posts about work. However, to view these profiles, users must have an account with Artists-Everywhere, and these accounts will be checked for 'bot-like' behavior.

-   Limit number of follows and friend additions per day.
-   Require the artist to add content before following anyone.
-   Use machine learning to determine if the machine is a bot.
-   Invite only.

### Revenue Ideas:

1. Have a social media feed section and run adds. Only provide users with DP numbers out though.
2. Have a job board and a way to search artists
